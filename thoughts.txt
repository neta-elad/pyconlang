  - Bound morphemes:
    - Types:
      - Derivational morpheme
      - Inflectional morpheme
    - Time of agglutination
    - Side (prefix/suffix)
  - Morpheme is expressed by a sequence of phonemes
    - Or a reference to a morpheme/lexeme (of older language?)
- Lexeme: unit of lexical meaning
  - Lexemes are comprised of a root morpheme (/ stem) + derivational morphemes
  - Lexeme is a set of words, that differ only by inflections (affixes)
  - Lexeme's set of words has a representative, called lemma
- Lexicon: set of morphemes + lexemes
- Language / scope / namespace:
  - A collection of lexemes
  - Languages are organized as a forest (i.e., many trees)
